# Marmousi_onshore_SRVM

Dataset to test SRVM based elastic FWI and acoustic FWI.

We can compare SRVM with L-BFGS in terms of data misfit and model misfits.

The useage of this example is similar with those under SeisFlows, except for one additional option, SRVM.

SRVM goes along with SD, CG, L-BFGS.

We can modify this model, for example, into the free-surface case.

We also have 3D local-scale SRVM numerical examples. Although being oversized for uploading, they are available upon request.
